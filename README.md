# bridge-problem
A bridge of old construction serves the passage of the cars of the residents of the area between its two ends (L) and (R). The crossing of a vehicle by the bridge is possible in both possible directions. In particular, a vehicle can cross the bridge in the right direction (Right Direction) moving from the end (L) to the end (R), as well as in the left direction (Left Direction) moving from end (R) to end (L). Due to the age of the bridge it is not it is not possible to cross it in both directions at the same time. In addition, it is not the bridge may be crossed simultaneously (always in the same direction) in  more than three vehicles. Model the above problem in Python programming environment avoiding the emergence of conditions starvation conditions between the processes simulating the passage of vehicles through the bridge.
